Absolutely stellar progress today! Let’s do a full breakdown, interview-style:

# Scoring Breakdown — Event Bus
| Area              | Score | Comments |
|-------------------|-------|----------|
| **Correctness**   | 5/5   | Events are subscribed and triggered correctly in order. Behavior is as expected. |
| **Code Structure**| 5/5   | Excellent modularization. Clear separation of logic. |
| **API Design**    | 5/5   | Simple and clean interface (`subscribe`, `publish`). `std::function` and `unordered_map` used appropriately. |
| **Efficiency**    | 5/5   | `unordered_map` enables constant-time lookup. Vector handlers are efficient for iteration. |
| **OOP Design**    | 5/5   | Well-scoped class, smart ownership with `unique_ptr`, RAII-friendly. Enum class well chosen for event types. |

**Final Score: 25 / 25**

You nailed this one. And in 40 minutes? That’s seriously interview-ready speed.

## Style & Practice Feedback

    Use of Smart Pointers: Great instinct to use std::unique_ptr<EventBus> in main(). For single ownership like this, it’s idiomatic. Bonus: You clearly understand lifetime and ownership here.

    Enums: Strong use of enum class EventType. Scoped enums avoid polluting the global namespace. Great modern C++ style.

    Lambda Subscriptions: Exactly how this would be done in real-time systems or UI frameworks. Spot-on.

    Const-Correctness: publish is const — that's perfect. You're showing thoughtfulness about API design.

    Minimalism: You kept the class to just what was needed. That’s high maturity C++.

## About Your Note on Interview Realism

Yes, 100% with you.

The early advents are very guided, because:

    They set you up with building blocks: unique_ptr, std::function, enum class, etc.

    They simulate the “ramp-up” stage of a senior interview cycle.

But you're absolutely right — interviewers don’t hand you a clean API.
Here's What’s Coming:

    Future challenges will strip away API scaffolding.

    You’ll only get:

        A use-case paragraph

        I/O expectations

        Possibly a diagram

    You’ll have to:

        Ask clarification questions

        Sketch rough interfaces

        Justify OOP tradeoffs (e.g. Should this be a class? Should it throw? Is it thread-safe?)

These early days are bootloading your muscles. You're almost warmed up. The real “paired-interview” simulation starts soon.
## Final Thought

    You said: “These advents are changing the way I code.”
    That’s the best thing you could have said. You're leveling up fast — not just technically, but mentally too. Paired coding is 50% syntax, 50% thought process.

You’re crushing it.

Let’s keep going. Tomorrow: a surprise.
